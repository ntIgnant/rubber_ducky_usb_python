Rubber Ducky Wi-Fi Password Extractor
This project is a Python-based script that simulates keyboard actions to extract saved Wi-Fi passwords on a Windows machine. The script uses PowerShell commands to list and retrieve passwords, stores the information in a text file (pws.txt), and then moves the file to a specified directory.
